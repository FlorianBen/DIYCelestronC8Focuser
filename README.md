# DIYCelestronC8Focuser (WIP)
DIY focuser for the Celestron C8 telescope aka poor's man focuser.

The main goal of this project is to provide a cheap solution for motorizing the focus rod of a Celestron C8 SCT.
Most of the work has been done using open source softwares.

The bill of material:
- Arduino Uno or Nano: 10€
- Case for the Arduino board and cable: 5€
- 28BYJ-48 motor and ULN2003 driver: 5€
- 3D priting service for the manufacturing: 40€ (or even less if you already have a 3D printer)

## 3D model

The 3D parts are heavily inspired by this [design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3552339/).

You have to switch off the coils if you use your own code to drive the stepper.

## Arduino code

The Arduino code uses two libraries . A state machine while the serial . The communication . During the motion
